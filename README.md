# PyTrain: Several Python Exercices to do.

PyFail is a suite of several exercises each one based on an aspect of Python Programming.

# How does it work ?

⚠️ ***The functions are only tested once you delete the '    ...' in the function def.***

1. Go to './src/'.

2. Choose a file and edit the functions as you wish.

3. Look for help in the Cheatsheet associated through my own hints or some cool courses I've found online (ie. 'Math Cheatsheet.md' for 'math.py').

4. run './train.py' to test your functions.

# Aspect covered ?
